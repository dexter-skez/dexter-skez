<section id="about-me">
  <h1>Hi, I'm Will 👋</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a Web Developer based in Devon, UK, focused on building fast, SEO-friendly sites 
    that actually move the needle for businesses. Day to day I work across 
    <strong>WordPress (Divi, WooCommerce)</strong>, <strong>Shopify</strong> and custom 
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> to turn messy requirements into clean, maintainable solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy that sweet spot where <strong>development, UX, and analytics</strong> overlap – 
    wiring up tracking, improving performance, and automating the boring bits so clients 
    and teams get better results with less faff.
  </p>

  <h2>What I work with</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React (learning & building side projects)</li>
    <li><strong>CMS & eCommerce:</strong> WordPress, Divi, WooCommerce, Shopify (themes, Liquid, custom sections)</li>
    <li><strong>Tooling & Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express, REST APIs, automation scripts</li>
    <li><strong>SEO & Analytics:</strong> Technical SEO, GA4, Google Tag Manager, tracking implementation, performance optimisation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I'm into right now</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Building more modular, reusable components in WordPress and Shopify</li>
    <li>Improving site performance (LCP, CLS, image optimisation, clean JS)</li>
    <li>Automating repetitive dev and SEO tasks with small tools and scripts</li>
    <li>Leveling up my React skills with practical, real-world projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <p>
    I like clear, honest communication, well-structured code, and small, frequent improvements 
    over big, risky changes. I'm happiest when I'm debugging something gnarly, refactoring 
    legacy code into something future-proof, or shipping small tools that make everyone's life easier.
