<section id="about-me">
  <h1>Hi, I'm Will 👋</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a Web Developer based in Devon, UK, with a strong focus on building fast, user-friendly, 
    SEO-optimised websites that genuinely help businesses grow. I work across 
    <strong>WordPress (Divi, WooCommerce)</strong>, <strong>Shopify</strong> and custom 
    <strong>JavaScript</strong>, turning ideas and messy requirements into clean, reliable solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    My background blends <strong>front-end development, SEO, CRO, UX thinking, and automation</strong>. 
    I love using tech to remove friction — whether that’s improving Core Web Vitals, 
    wiring up accurate tracking, refining user journeys, or building simple tools that cut hours of 
    repetitive work into seconds. If something can be automated, streamlined, or made more efficient, 
    I’m usually already on it.
  </p>

  <h2>What I work with</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React (learning & building side projects)</li>
    <li><strong>WordPress:</strong> Divi, WooCommerce, custom themes, performance tuning</li>
    <li><strong>Shopify:</strong> Liquid, custom sections, product configurators</li>
    <li><strong>SEO & CRO:</strong> Technical SEO, content structure, GA4, Tag Manager, A/B testing, UX refinement</li>
    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Lightweight tools, scripts and workflows to eliminate repetitive tasks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I'm into right now</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Automating repetitive dev and SEO workflows</li>
    <li>Building modular, reusable components for WordPress and Shopify</li>
    <li>Improving performance (LCP, CLS, image optimisation, cleaner JS)</li>
    <li>Enhancing user journeys with better UX and CRO thinking</li>
    <li>Leveling up my React skills through practical real-world projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <p>
    I’m big on clear communication, tidy code, and steady, meaningful improvements. 
    I enjoy debugging awkward problems, refining legacy code into something future-proof, 
    and creating digital experiences that feel effortless for users. 
    Challenges that mix creativity, problem-solving, analytics, and automation are where I do my best work.
